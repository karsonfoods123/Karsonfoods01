During the state shutdown of schools and most child and adult care programs, Karson Food Service is supplying reimbursable meals to anyone in need. We are providing schools and preschools/child care centers that are closed with a grab and go breakfast and lunch. 
We will prepare the meals at our facility and deliver them to the school or school assigned designated area. The student can pick their meal up from the school or the schools designated spot, and take it home with them. We can offer this daily, or deliver multiple days at once, depending on the schools preference. There are a large portion of needy children in the state that count on their school breakfast and lunch often as their only meal of the day. 
Karson Foods is committed to be your Emergency Meal provider and continue to offer meals even during school and child care closures. We will also provide hot meals to those that have the capability to serve hot. Any program that is need of emergency food during the corona virus outbreak, Karson Food Service is here to fulfil your needs.
